## Information from the Course Website

### Purpose

>Knowing your grade throughout the term is one of the most critical tools you have at your disposal as a student. Without this knowledge, it becomes incredibly difficult to assess your knowledge of the subject matter relative to a course. It also means not knowing where you stand in a course and more importantly whether you may truly need help or not.

>This project, when successfully compiled, will alleviate that concern for this course. An effective output will provide merely a course grade calculated based on all possible points that can be earned within the course.


### Requirements
---
#### Program
-[ ] Write a program to successfully evaluate individual deliverables from CSC 212 to provide an accurate output of semester course grades. Viewable outputs should include:
- [ ] individual: returns an individual deliverable name and grade
- [ ] category: returns all grades from the category and category total
- [ ] course: ability to return each of the following:
  - all grades within their respective categories and a course overall
  - only category totals and course overall
  - only the course overall
- [ ] clear, conscientious comments embedded within the your code
- [ ] successfully compiles accurate output
---
#### GitHub
- [ ] a _primary_repository to house your program
- proof of contribution
  - [ ] `commit` and `push` actions made by each group member
---
#### Documentation README.md
- [ ] a brief summary of the project
- [ ] evidence of planning:
  - pseudocode/flowcharts
  - *note: anything other than pseudocode/flowcharts will not be accepted*
- [ ] provide detailed instructions for compiling/using your program
  - command line prompts
  - function/method calls
  - etc...
---
#### Recorded Walkthrough
- [ ] provide a 10-15 minute code analysis (>15 minutes will result in loss of credit)
- [ ] describe the different aspects of your code: how it works and how your group concluded on your implementations
- [ ] compile your code demonstrating a working prototype using all possible function/method calls and outputs
- [ ] inputs/outputs: exemplify the use of three different data sets showing variation and proving the program works under various entry conditions
---
#### Datasets
- [ ] Include a mock dataset for each group member
  - *Note: hardcoding datasets is allowed as the use of databases is not required/desired for this project.*
- [ ] Use only knowledge learned prior to and outside of CSC 212
- [ ] Required Structures
- [ ] Your program must implement `Class` structures and use `vectors` over `arrays`
